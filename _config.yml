            - Designed and led the security assessment activities required as part of the Authority to Operate process in line with NIST 800-37 and the ISM for a complex large scale Azure cloud project. Built rapport with stakeholders such as cloud engineers, project managers, and IT management to foster a collaborative project mindset, and modularised security testing to ensure that the highest and most urgent risks were tested and treated first. The project received ATO for production without security ever being the bottleneck to progress. 
            - Led threat detection engineering activities during a significant purple team assessment operation in collaboration with ACSCâ€™s Cyber Maturity team, recording all malicious activities in a super timeline and ensuring that all findings were mitigated, preventable or detectable. This was achieved with a combination of Sentinel/Defender KQL queries, converting Sigma and Yara rules for ArcSight ESM compatibility. 
            - Deployed custom honeypots to detect stealthy bloodhound scans, Kerberoasting and DCSync Attacks, and popular windows privilege escalation scripts and techniques such as PowerUp, and designed future strategies for the implementation of canaries.

          I'm greatly enjoying the research and deep thought on cyber topics that is encouraged in this degree.

          I'm proud of the research I have undertaken on BYOD related vulnerabilities.
