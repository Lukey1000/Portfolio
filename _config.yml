  Hi, I'm Luke and I'm an Infosec nerd, currently employed as an Information Security Officer with a federal government department.
  I've had an incredibly rewarding career making problems with technology go away, some highlights include:
  - Setting up a temporary office for the prime minister inside a castle in the UK during COVID. Seriously, those castle designers could have included some ethernet ports in the walls.
  - The privilege of attending ANZAC Day ceremonies at Amiens in France in 2018 as part of the Australian Delegation.
  - Collaborating with ASD as the blue half of an extensive purple team operation. 
    
  The purpose of this site is to experiment with and expose myself to DevSecOps, Git, and various webdev technologies like Ruby on Rails.

          I've got so many certifications there's no point. I'm proudest of being GIAC Experienced Incident Handler #346. Current Goals
          - CISSP. Exam in December 2023.
          - CISA. This + CISSP would make me eligible for IRAP.
          - GIAC Security Expert. Just need to pass 3 more GSE level exams, and complete 3 more certs.
          - Azure Security Architect Expert. Whenever I can be bothered to study for it.
          - OSCP. Whenever I get a spare 2 days with no interruptions.
