  Hi, I'm Luke and I'm an Infosec nerd.
  I have nearly two decades of diverse IT experiences in more than 50 countries that range from solving mid-flight IT issues for the Prime Minister on his RAAF Aircraft to collaborating with ASD on purple team operations.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Incident Handling</mark> and <mark>Customer Service</mark>

          I started this project as a way of proving that 'secure' BYOD systems have a blindspot: the home of the user.

            - Designed and led the security assessment activities required as part of the Authority to Operate process in line with NIST 800-37 and the ISM for a complex large scale Azure cloud project. Built rapport with stakeholders such as cloud engineers, project managers, and IT management to foster a collaborative project mindset, and modularised security testing to ensure that the highest and most urgent risks were tested and treated first. The project received ATO for production without security ever being the bottleneck to progress. 
            - Led threat detection engineering activities during a significant purple team assessment operation in collaboration with ASDs Cyber Maturity team, recording all malicious activities in a super timeline and ensuring that all findings were mitigated, preventable or detectable. This was achieved with a combination of <mark>Sentinel</mark>/Defender KQL queries, and converting Sigma and Yara rules for ArcSight ESM compatibility. 
            - Deployed custom honeypots to detect stealthy bloodhound scans, Kerberoasting and DCSync Attacks, and popular windows privilege escalation scripts and techniques such as PowerUp, and designed future strategies for the implementation of canaries.

          The Master of Cyber Security (Digital Forensics) at UNSW Canberra provides students with the knowledge, understanding and skills to enable the recovery of admissible evidence from digital media. Students will understand the ethical and legal issues associated with cybercrime investigations and develop decision-making tools to assess, evaluate and analyse digital data.

          I'm greatly enjoying the research and deep thought on cyber topics that is encouraged in this degree.

          I'm proud of the research I have undertaken on BYOD related vulnerabilities.
