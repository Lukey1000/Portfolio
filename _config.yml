  Hi, I'm Luke and I'm an Infosec nerd, currently employed as an Information Security Officer with a federal government department.
  I've had an incredibly rewarding career making problems with technology go away, some highlights include:
  - Setting up a temporary office for the prime minister inside a castle in the UK during COVID. Seriously, those castle designers could have included some ethernet ports in the walls.
  - The privilege of attending ANZAC day at Gallipoli in Turkey in 2015, and Amiens in France in 2018, as part of the Australian Delegation. 
  - Being the blue half of a 3 week purple team operation with ASD.
  
  The purpose of this site is to experiment with and expose myself to DevSecOps, Git, and various webdev technologies.

          I'm greatly enjoying the research and deep thought on cyber topics that is encouraged in this degree.

          I'm proud of the research I have undertaken on BYOD related vulnerabilities.

          I started this project as a way of proving that 'secure' BYOD systems have a blindspot: the home of the user.
