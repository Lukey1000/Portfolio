  Hi, I'm Luke and I'm an infosec nerd.

  The purpose of this site is partly ensuring that my familiarity with git, web development, and devops stays up to date, and also because I really need to start centrally saving all the cool scripts I write.
  I'm also planning to upload some of my obsidian notes from pentesting here for easy access and sync.

          I'm greatly enjoying the deep thought on cybersecurity required to excel in this program.
          Highlights so far include:
          - A semester spent researching BYOD vulnerabilities and developing a proof of concept for a website cloning credential stealer.
          - Developing a futuristic Scrum model that replaced the Scrum Master with an AI.
